It's just fitting to start off my personal blog about software development with the most iconic phrase in the whole industry - Hello World!

It's just a shame that: 🤷‍😅

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the world never says hello back</p>&mdash; Computer Facts (@computerfact) <a href="https://twitter.com/computerfact/status/930555503821905921?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2017</a></blockquote>

Anyways, I'm glad you stumbled upon this site.

My name's Mykolas and I'm a software developer from Vilnius, Lithuania.

This is where I hope to share my insights and thoughts about technology and development in general. Hopefully, the content is fun and useful. 🤞

Stay tuned!
